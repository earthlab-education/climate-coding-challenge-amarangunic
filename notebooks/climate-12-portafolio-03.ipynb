    "dataset compiles daily climate observations from approximately 30 \n",
    "different data sources. These observations are collected by various \n",
    "entities or organizations responsible for maintaining weather stations \n",
    "around the world. The data are gathered from over 90,000 land-based \n",
    "stations globally.\n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum temperature units in the dataset are typically recorded in \n",
    "degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit, depending on the source of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data collection involves the daily recording of meteorological elements \n",
    "such as daily maximum and minimum temperatures, temperature at the time \n",
    "of observation, precipitation, snowfall, and snow depth. These measurements \n",
    "are usually taken at specific times each day by automated weather stations \n",
    "and manually by trained observers at various weather stations worldwide. \n",
    "The data are then compiled and processed to create a comprehensive dataset \n",
    "that captures daily climate observations from a wide range of locations.\n",
